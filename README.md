# 👋 Hi, I'm Brigham Pettit (he/him)

I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M (Class of 2025). I have a deep interest in the ways technology intersects with people — especially through **AI, ethics, and human psychology**.

During my time at A&M, I got to experience a wide variety of disciplines and team dynamics, from working as a full-stack dev on real-world projects to working as an academic researcher in both traditional psychology and HCI-oriented AI work. My honors thesis tackled semantics-driven cognitive modeling — blending computation with emotion in ways that felt both useful and ethical.

Outside of the technical and academic world, I'm a poet and a musician. I made it a point throughout my undergraduate education to balance my technical growth with the development of my voice and skill as an artist, and I think both sides of my life have benefitted from this multidisciplinary practice. For example, I've come to think of code and poetry from a similar lens: both, at their core, must concisely communicate some complex idea between the writer and reader. This leads to an understanding of the value of self-documenting code and self-aware poems.

### 🔭 What I've Been Working On

- **Emotion modeling & AI ethics** — Developed a semantics-based approach to emotion analysis for my honors thesis, with a focus on ethical system design.
- **Research** — Co-authored papers on anomaly detection, emotion prediction, and human behavior in social relationships.
- **Software development** — Built and maintained .NET and full-stack web applications in Agile teams, always with an eye toward usability and clarity.

### 🌱 What I'm Exploring Next

- Research opportunities in **AI ethics**, **HCI**, or **cognitive systems**
- Software development roles that value interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration
- Ways to stay curious — in work, in writing, and in the world

---

### 💼 I'm open to...

- Research assistantships, labs, or fellowships  
- Full-stack roles on thoughtful engineering teams  
- Coffee chats about tech, language, or the limits of machine learning
